# GreenPOS is a Java Point Of Sales software forked from OpenBravoPOS. #

This fork was created to the POS for a Dry Cleaner.

I added these functionalities :

  * Date of return from cleaning
  * Date we do return it to the customer
  * New reports
  * Synchronisation with Joomla Virtuemart by web services (vm\_soa) (customers, products and orders)
  * Credit for customers (negative debt)
  * Added many filters and quick access to search dialogs
  * Printing enhanced
  * Hostname displayed on main panel
  * Main panel rebates
  * Take away button for Belgium's VAT
  * ...

The pos is already used in different restaurants and dry cleaners and works perfectly.

I tried to keep all original functionalities of OpenBravoPOS so it should work like the original. You might want to contact me if you want to setup the POS with Virtuemart as I did it for a specific company and, even if I tried to make it generic, it's not perfect, you might have to change some of the code before you start.

I'm looking for help for developing, translate and document.
